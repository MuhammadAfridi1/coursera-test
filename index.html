            <h2>Introduction</h2>
           <p> I was born in 2005 in <a href="https://msafridi.studio/peshawar">Peshawar</a>, <a href="https://msafridi.studio/pakistan">Pakistan</a>, and am proud to belong to the Afridi clan from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. My passion for computer science has been a driving force throughout my life.</p>

<p>I completed my high schooling at Government Higher Secondary School, Samabadaber, with an impressive 90% marks. Following that, I enrolled in the University of the People for online studies while also pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Engineering and Technology (UET) Peshawar.</p>

<p>In addition to my formal education, I have undertaken various online courses, the details of which can be found in the Certification section. My language skills include complete command of English, Urdu, and Pashto, and I am at an upper-intermediate level in German. I am also proficient in Microsoft tools such as Word and Excel.</p>

<p>My experiences extend beyond academics. I have volunteered as a tutor, helping students with their studies. Additionally, I participated in football tournaments, though I chose to step away from the sport due to personal preferences.</p>
