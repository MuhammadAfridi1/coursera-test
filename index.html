            <h3 class="heading">Personal information</h3>
            <p>I was born in 2005 in <a href="https://msafridi.studio/peshawar">Peshawar</a>, <a href="https://msafridi.studio/pakistan">Pakistan</a>, and I belong to the Afridi clan from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. From a young age, I have been deeply interested in computer science. Despite the limited opportunities in my city, I was determined to pursue my passion.</p>

               <p>My journey began with high schooling at a government school, where I excelled despite the challenges. I was fortunate to secure several full-time scholarships, which enabled me to continue my education in the field I love.</p>
                
               <p> Currently, I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Engineering and Technology (<a href="https://www.uetpeshawar.edu.pk/">UET</a>) Peshawar. In addition to my studies at UET Peshawar, I have also enrolled in various international universities to broaden my knowledge and skills in computer science.</p>
                
               <p>The evolution of technology fascinates me immensely. The transition from 27-ton computers to those weighing just 50 grams is truly remarkable. This rapid advancement in technology continues to inspire and motivate me as I strive to contribute to this dynamic field.</p>
